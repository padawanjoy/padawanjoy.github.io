Interacting with web pages forms a core part of enhancing user experience. In this post, we'll explore how to use JavaScript to respond to user actions by handling events.

## What are Events?
Events refer to all the interactions a user can have with a web page, such as clicking a button, hovering over an element, or entering keystrokes. JavaScript allows us to detect these events and execute desired actions in response.

## Adding Event Listeners
To handle an event, we must first add an event listener to the element we want to monitor. An event listener is a function that will be called whenever the specified event occurs:

```javascript
let button = document.getElementById('myButton');
button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert('The button was clicked!');
});
```

## Various Event Types
There are various event types like **`click`**, **`mouseover`**, **`mouseout`**, and **`keydown`** that enable you to respond to different user actions.

## The Event Object
Event listener functions can receive an event object as a parameter, which contains detailed information about the event that occurred.

## Practice: Creating a Color Change Button
Let's make a button on a web page that changes the background color to a random color each time it's clicked.

1. Add a button to your HTML file:

```html
<button id="colorButton">Change Background Color</button>
```

2. Use JavaScript to add an event listener to the button and implement the color change feature:

```javascript
function getRandomColor() {
  var letters = '0123456789ABCDEF';
  var color = '#';
  for (var i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    color += letters[Math.floor(Math.random() * 16)];
  }
  return color;
}

let button = document.getElementById('colorButton');
button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = getRandomColor();
});
```

This code includes a **`getRandomColor`** function that generates a random color code. When the button is clicked, **`document.body.style.backgroundColor`** changes the page's background color to the newly generated color.
