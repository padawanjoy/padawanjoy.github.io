Next.js has become an essential framework in modern web development, offering a range of features and benefits that make building applications easier, faster, and more efficient. Based on React, this framework allows developers to enhance their web applications with server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes, among other advanced features. In this article, we will explore what Next.js is, its advantages, its relationship with React, how to use it, and the latest updates regarding its versions.

## Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is a React framework designed to simplify the implementation of advanced web development features such as server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes. It enables performance optimization, SEO-friendly page generation, and streamlines the development process of web applications.

## Advantages of Next.js

1. **Automatic Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Delivers pages faster to users, which is beneficial for search engine optimization (SEO).
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Builds your site at build time, enabling fast loading times and efficient caching.
3. **File-based Routing:** Automatically sets up routes based on the file structure in the `pages` directory.
4. **API Routes:** Easily create API endpoints to manage backend logic within the same project.
5. **Rich Plugin Ecosystem and Community Support:** Easily add various functionalities and receive support from an active community.

## Relationship with React

Next.js is built on top of React. This means that a basic understanding of React is necessary to use Next.js. It maintains Reactâ€™s component-based development methodology while adding additional features and optimizations. Components built with React can be utilized within the Next.js framework, where Next.js assists in efficiently server-side rendering those components or generating them as static sites.

## How to Use It

### Creating a Project

Starting a new Next.js project is straightforward. You can create a new Next.js application using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest your-project-name
```

During this process, you have the option to create a **`src`** folder. If you choose to create a **`src`** folder, the structure of your project will slightly differ. Traditionally, Next.js stores route-associated files within the **`pages`** folder. However, with a **`src`** folder, you can modularize your project further into **`src/pages`**, **`src/components`**, etc.

### Creating Pages and Routing

- **When using a pages/index.js structure:** This file represents the homepage of your website. For example, you can write:

```jsx
function HomePage() {
  return <div>Welcome to Next.js!</div>;
}

export default HomePage;
```

- **When using a src/app/page.js & layout.js structure:** Choosing the **`src`** folder in the latest versions changes how pages and layouts are managed. The **`page.js`** file is used for the main components of each page, while **`layout.js`** defines the common layout for pages.

### Client Components and Server Components

In the latest versions of Next.js, the distinction between client components and server components has become more pronounced. Caution is needed when using React hooks such as **`useState`**, which are only usable within client components. Attempting to use these hooks in server components can result in the following warning message:

```
You're importing a component that needs useState. It only works in a Client Component but none of its parents are marked with "use client", so they're Server Components by default.
```

This means that certain components must be explicitly marked to render only on the client side. Detailed discussions on [this topic will be covered in a separate post](https://padawanjoy.com/blog/resolving-errors-with-hooks-like-usestate-in-nextjs).

## Conclusion

Next.js is a powerful tool for developing React-based web applications. It offers a variety of features such as server-side rendering, static site generation, and automatic routing, which help developers build high-quality websites more easily and quickly. Utilizing the capabilities of Next.js can improve user experience, achieve search engine optimization, and simplify the development process.
