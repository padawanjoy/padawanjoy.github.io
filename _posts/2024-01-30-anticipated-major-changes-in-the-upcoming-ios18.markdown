## The Arrival of iOS 18
Expectations are steadily rising for Apple's next operating system, iOS 18. This update is anticipated to be one of the most significant in Apple's history, particularly with the massive integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. According to [Mark Gurman, an expert on Apple and a journalist at Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AS7Hj1mBMGM/mark-gurman), iOS 18 is poised to fundamentally transform the iPhone user experience.

## Emergence of New AI Features
Slated for an initial reveal at WWDC 2024 in June, iOS 18 is expected to be officially released in September. Craig Federighi, the Senior Vice President of Software Engineering at Apple, referred to iOS 18 internally as 'Crystal,' suggesting that this update will bring innovative changes across all aspects.

One of the most noticeable changes is the enhancement of AI features. As Samsung and Google already lead the AI smartphone market, Apple is also making strides to bolster its competitiveness in this area. iOS 18 aims to equip the iPhone 16 series with AI capabilities, marking Apple's first foray into AI smartphones. This move promises to provide existing iPhone users with an upgraded experience through the update.

## Siri's Transformation
The revamp of Siri, Apple's AI assistant, is another significant update. Plans are in place to apply a large language model to Siri, enhancing its intelligence. This change signifies a shift from Siri simply executing commands to performing more complex tasks as a generative AI.

## Innovation in Messaging and Music Apps
The message app's ability to complete sentences using AI, and Apple Music's feature of automatically creating playlists based on user preferences, are also expected. This innovative approach aims to personalize and enhance the user experience.

Years ago, watching Iron Man's Jarvis, I dreamt of having such a smart AI assistant. iOS 18 appears to be a crucial step for Apple in fully entering the AI era. Personally, I am eager to compare the AI capabilities of the new iPhone, equipped with iOS 18, and the already available Samsung Galaxy S24. I look forward to experiencing firsthand how the advancements in AI technology will bring changes to our daily lives.
