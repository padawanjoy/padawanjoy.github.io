In Android app development, encountering the **`android.content.pm.PackageManager$NameNotFoundException`** error can be a part of the journey. This error usually occurs when attempting to retrieve information about other apps using the PackageManager. It might seem a bit perplexing at first, but knowing why it happens and how to resolve it is key.

![android.content.pm.PackageManager$NameNotFoundException]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/2024-01-25-name-not-found-exception-error-in-android/02.png)
*android.content.pm.PackageManager$NameNotFoundException*

The primary reason for this error is the package visibility changes in Android 11. Apps targeting Android 11 or higher can no longer directly see the list of other apps installed on a device. Instead, they are limited to accessing information about apps specifically declared in the manifest file, akin to setting up Queried URL Schemes in iOS.

With this change, apps targeting Android 11 or higher might encounter issues with the following APIs:

* **PackageManager.getPackageInfo()**
* **PackageManager.getInstalledPackages()**
* **PackageManager.queryIntentActivities()**
* **PackageManager.getInstalledApplications()**
* **bindService()**

For apps targeting Android 11 or above, it's important to add the **`<queries>`** element in the **`AndroidManifest.xml`** file. This element is used to specify the package names or intent filter signatures you intend to query.

Here’s how you can specify package names and intent filters:

1. **Specifying Package Names:** Use the **`<package>`** tag within the **`<queries>`** to list the specific packages you're querying.

```xml
<manifest package="com.padawanjoy.example">
    <queries>
        <package android:name="com.otherapp.example" />
    </queries>
    ...
</manifest>
```

2. **Specifying Intent Filters:** Include the **`<intent>`** tag within the **`<queries>`** to detail the intent filters you want to query.

```xml
<manifest package="com.padawanjoy.example">
    <queries>
        <intent>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND" />
            <data android:mimeType="image/jpeg" />
        </intent>
    </queries>
    ...
</manifest>
```

If there’s a need to query information about all apps, the **`QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`** permission can be utilized. However, it’s worth noting that using this permission can lead to a more stringent review process when uploading your app to Google Play. Hence, it’s recommended to use this permission only when absolutely necessary.

A brief summary for resolving this error:

* Add the **`<queries>`** element to your **`AndroidManifest.xml`** if targeting Android 11 or higher.
* Specify the package names or intent filters in the **`<queries>`** element.
* Resort to using the **`QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`** permission only when it's essential.

I hope this article helps you in dealing with the **`PackageManager$NameNotFoundException`** error in your Android app development process. App development can present unexpected challenges, but with the right knowledge and strategies, these hurdles can be effectively overcome.
