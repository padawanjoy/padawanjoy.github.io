Hello, Apple developers! When developing apps in Xcode, occasionally, we encounter some headaches. One such issue is the 'Cloud signing permission error'. In this article, weâ€™ll guide you through easy and clear steps to resolve this error.

Firstly, this error typically occurs when building or archiving an app in Xcode, or during the binary upload process for app review. The error message reads:

![Cloud signing permission error]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/2024-01-24-solving-the-cloud-signing-permission-error-in-xcode/02.png)
*Cloud signing permission error*

The reason for this message is straightforward. It appears when you are working in the Apple Developer Program with regular developer permissions and do not have access to cloud-managed distribution certificates. Letâ€™s delve into the solutions.

The first and obvious solution is to request admin rights from the account owner or an administrator. You can check and modify the granted permissions on the [Users and Access page](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/developers).

However, obtaining Admin rights in every scenario is not always feasible. In such cases, check your account settings. Look for the 'Access to Cloud Managed Distribution Certificate' option and make sure it is enabled. If not, you need to request to have this option enabled.

*'Access to Cloud Managed Distribution Certificate' option*

If this request is challenging or if you cannot wait for a timely application, there is another solution. In Xcode, go to the 'Signing & Capabilities' section and uncheck the 'Automatically manage signing' option.

Then, manually set up a provisioning profile. You can download this profile from the ['Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles' page](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list). Once downloaded, double-clicking the profile will add it to the Keychain Access, and it will be available for use in Xcode.

To summarize, the solutions to resolve the Cloud signing permission error are as follows:

1. Obtain Account Holder or Admin rights in the Apple Developer Program.
2. In the Users and Access page, ensure the 'Access to Cloud Managed Distribution Certificate' option is enabled.
3. In Xcode, uncheck the 'Automatically manage signing' option and use a downloaded provisioning profile.

We hope this article helps you in your development work. May it make navigating the various challenges a bit smoother. Best of luck! ðŸ––
