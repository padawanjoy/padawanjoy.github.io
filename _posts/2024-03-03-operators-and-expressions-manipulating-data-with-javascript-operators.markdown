## Basics of Operators
Operators are symbols used to manipulate data and produce outcomes. For example, the **`+`** operator adds two numbers together. Operators act on operands (the subjects of the operation), and the combination of operators and operands forms an 'expression'.

## Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations. The most common arithmetic operators include addition (**`+`**), subtraction (**`-`**), multiplication (**`*`**), and division (**`/`**). For instance, the expression **`let result = 10 + 5;`** adds 10 and 5 together and assigns the value to the **`result`** variable.

## Comparison Operators
Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean value, true or false. For example, the **`==`** operator checks if two values are equal, while the **`>`** operator checks if the left value is greater than the right one.

## Logical Operators
Logical operators manipulate boolean values (true or false). The most common logical operators are AND (**`&&`**), OR (**`||`**), and NOT (**`!`**). For example, the expression **`let isAdult = age > 18 && isMember;`** returns true only if the user is over 18 and a member.

## Practice: Examples Using Operators
Let's practice using operators with a simple example. Hereâ€™s how you could write code to output "Adult" or "Minor" based on a user's age:

```javascript
let age = 20;
let status = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
console.log(status);
```

This code uses the ternary operator (**`? :`**) to assign different strings to the **`status`** variable based on the **`age`** value.

In this post, we learned about the basic operators in JavaScript and how to create expressions using these operators. This foundational knowledge will help you implement more complex logic in JavaScript.
