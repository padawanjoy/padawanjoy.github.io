Welcome to the next phase of our JavaScript journey! Today, we are going to delve into conditional statements in JavaScript. Conditional statements allow your program to perform different actions based on different conditions, playing a crucial role in controlling the flow of the program.

## What Are Conditional Statements?
Conditional statements evaluate a condition's truth or falsehood and decide whether to execute a block of code accordingly. This enables the program to respond appropriately to different situations.

## The if Statement
The **`if`** statement is the most basic form of conditional statements. It executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. For example, to check if a user is over 18 years old, you can write:

```javascript
let age = 20;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
}
```

## The else if and else Statements
The **`else if`** statement is used to test several conditions sequentially. The **`else`** statement defines a block of code to be executed if all conditions are false:

```javascript
if (age < 13) {
  console.log("You are a child.");
} else if (age < 18) {
  console.log("You are a teenager.");
} else {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
}
```

## The switch Statement
The **`switch`** statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions of a variable. Each case is marked by the **`case`** keyword:

```javascript
let grade = 'A';
switch (grade) {
  case 'A':
    console.log("Excellent grade.");
    break;
  case 'B':
    console.log("Good grade.");
    break;
  // additional cases
  default:
    console.log("No grade information available.");
}
```

## Practice: Examples Using Conditional Statements
Now, letâ€™s use conditional statements to create a simple example. Here's code that prints different messages based on a user's score:

```javascript
let score = 85;
if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
  console.log("Grade B");
} else {
  console.log("Grade C or below");
}
```
