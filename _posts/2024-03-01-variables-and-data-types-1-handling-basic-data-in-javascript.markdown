Welcome to the second step of our JavaScript journey! Today, we will delve into the fundamental elements of JavaScript: 'variables' and 'data types.' Understanding these concepts is crucial for storing, processing data, and bringing your code to life.

## What is a Variable?
A variable is a container for storing data. In JavaScript, variables can be declared using the **`var`**, **`let`**, or **`const`** keywords. For example, if we want to keep track of the price of apples in a store, we could use a variable like **`let applePrice = 100;`**.

## Data Types in JavaScript
There are several data types in JavaScript, but today we'll focus on the basic types: Number, String, and Boolean.

- **Number**: Represents all kinds of numbers. Example: **`let age = 25;`**
- **String**: Represents text and is enclosed in quotes. Example: **`let name = "Alice";`**
- **Boolean**: Represents a logical entity and can have two values: true or false. Example: **`let isStudent = true;`**

## Declaring and Initializing Variables
Declaring a variable means creating it. You can use **`let`** or **`const`** for declaring variables, and you can assign a value to them during initialization.

```javascript
let message; // declaration
message = 'Hello, JavaScript!'; // initialization
```

## Practice: Simple Example of Using Variables
Now, let's use a simple example to apply what we've learned. Letâ€™s store the number of books you have in a variable.

```javascript
let numberOfBooks = 30;
alert('I have ' + numberOfBooks + ' books.');
```

This code will display the message 'I have 30 books.' on the screen.
