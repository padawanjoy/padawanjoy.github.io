In our journey through JavaScript, arrays are an essential element. They provide a structured way to store multiple pieces of information. In this post, we will dive into the fundamentals of JavaScript arrays and explore how to efficiently manage lists with array methods.

## What is an Array?
An array is a data structure used to store multiple values in a single variable. Each item in an array has an index, and in JavaScript, arrays are treated as objects.

## Creating Arrays
In JavaScript, you create an array by enclosing values within square brackets **`[]`**, separated by commas:

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
```

## Introduction to Array Methods
### push() Method
The **`push()`** method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

```javascript
fruits.push("Mango");
console.log(fruits); // ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Mango"]
```

### pop() Method
The **`pop()`** method removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

```javascript
let lastFruit = fruits.pop();
console.log(lastFruit); // "Mango"
console.log(fruits); // ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
```

## Iterating Through Arrays
### forEach() Method
The **`forEach()`** method executes a provided function once for each array element.

```javascript
fruits.forEach(function(fruit, index) {
    console.log(`${index + 1}: ${fruit}`);
});
// "1: Apple"
// "2: Banana"
// "3: Cherry"
```

## Practice: Using Arrays and Methods
Now, create your own list of hobbies and add a new hobby. Then print each one:

```javascript
let hobbies = ["Reading", "Hiking", "Cooking"];
hobbies.push("Traveling");
hobbies.forEach(hobby => {
    console.log(hobby);
});
```
