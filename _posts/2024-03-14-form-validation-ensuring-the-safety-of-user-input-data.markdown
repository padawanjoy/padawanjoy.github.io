## What is Form Validation?
Form validation is the process of verifying that the data entered by users in a form matches the expected format. It prevents the submission of incorrect data and guides users to enter data correctly.

## HTML5 Form Validation
HTML5 introduces attributes like **`required`**, **`type`**, and **`pattern`**, which you can use to implement basic validation. For example, when creating an email field, you might write:

```html
<form>
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" required>
  <input type="submit">
</form>
```

This code ensures that the user inputs a valid email address and does not leave the field empty.

## Validating with JavaScript
For more complex validation scenarios, JavaScript can be utilized. For instance, to validate the length of a password, you could use the following code:

```javascript
document.getElementById('myForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
  let password = document.getElementById('password').value;
  
  if(password.length < 8) {
    alert('The password must be at least 8 characters long.');
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission
  }
});
```

## Practice: Creating a Simple Login Form
Letâ€™s create a simple login form that checks whether a username has been entered and whether the password is at least 8 characters long:

```html
<form id="loginForm">
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" required>
  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="password" required>
  <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>
```

```javascript
document.getElementById('loginForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
  let username = document.getElementById('username').value;
  let password = document.getElementById('password').value;
  
  if(!username || password.length < 8) {
    alert('Please enter a username and set the password to be at least 8 characters long.');
    event.preventDefault();
  }
});
```
