## Objects: The Basics of Data Structures
An object is a data structure that consists of key-value pairs. For example, to store information about a user, you can use an object like this:

```javascript
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isStudent: false
};
```

Objects allow you to organize related data in one place, and you can access the data using **`user.name`** or **`user['age']`**.

## Arrays: Managing Lists
Arrays are used to store multiple values in an ordered manner. For instance, you can represent a list of your favorite books as an array:

```javascript
let books = ["Harry Potter", "The Hobbit", "Pride and Prejudice"];
```

Each element in the array can be accessed by its index, with **`books[0]`** returning "Harry Potter".

## Functions: Units of Action
A function is a bundle of code that performs a specific task. For example, a function that adds two numbers can be written as follows:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Calling this function with **`add(5, 3)`** will return 8.

## Practice: Using Objects and Arrays

Now, let's use objects and arrays together to create an object that holds information about a library:

```javascript
let library = {
  books: ["Harry Potter", "The Hobbit", "Pride and Prejudice"],
  displayBooks: function() {
    this.books.forEach(book => {
      console.log(book);
    });
  }
};

library.displayBooks();
```

This code will display all books in the library on the console.
