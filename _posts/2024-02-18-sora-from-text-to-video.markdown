## The Magic of Converting Text into Videos

In an era where we witness new technological advancements daily, OpenAI's 'Sora' stands out as a dazzling innovation. Sora is a model capable of generating up to one-minute-long videos based on user input text. Though not yet released to the public, it has already garnered significant attention. This technology boasts the ability to rapidly create original characters and complex scenes.

## How Sora Works

Sora takes text input, interprets it, and generates attractive characters and scenes, expressing vivid emotions in the process. It understands how prompts could physically exist in the world, signifying a monumental leap in AI technology.

## Sora vs. Existing Video Generation AIs

When compared to existing video generation AI services like Stable Video Diffusion (SVD), Pika, and Runway Gen-2, Sora demonstrates superior performance. While previous models managed small movements naturally, they struggled with larger movements and human motion, often resulting in awkwardness. On the contrary, Sora impressively handles large-scale movements, camera motions, and human actions with remarkable naturalness. (This assessment is based on sample videos released by OpenAI. The actual performance will need to be re-evaluated upon the service's launch.)

## What Sets Sora Apart

Beyond merely generating videos, Sora can intricately fulfill prompts, demonstrating a deep understanding of language and physical reality. This capability means the videos it produces are not only dynamic but also highly realistic.

## The Future of Technology and Ethical Considerations

The advent of technologies like Sora holds great potential for societal benefits but also poses risks, such as the spread of misinformation. OpenAI recognizes these concerns and has implemented measures like the Red Team system for AI safety verification and standards to distinguish AI-generated videos from real ones, mitigating potential misuse.

## A New Horizon in AI Technology Development

Sora redefines the limits of AI technology, enabling creative transformations from text to video. This opens up endless possibilities for creators, showcasing how technological advancements can turn imagination into reality. The future of AI technology is bright, and Sora marks an important milestone in this journey.

## Conclusion

This article aims to spark reflection on the transformative potential of innovative AI technologies like Sora and their societal implications. The rapid advancement of AI technology brings daily surprises, placing us at the heart of this innovation.

I will soon take a closer look at the technical report for the Sora model released by OpenAI and return with a post about it.
